            leaves are opposite or in whorls of three or four, 5–50 centimetres (2.0–20 in) long and
            3–25 centimetres (1.2–9.8 in) broad, dark green and glossy with a leathery texture. The
            flowers are solitary or in small clusters, white, or pale yellow, with a tubular-based
            corolla with 5-12 lobes (petals) from 5–12 centimetres (2.0–4.7 in) diameter. Flowering
            is from about mid-spring to mid-summer and many species are strongly scented.</p>

Because they originated
            in warm humid tropical areas, they demand high humidity to thrive. They flourish in
            acidic soils with good drainage and thrive on [68-74 F temperatures (20-23 C)] during
            the day and 60 F (15-16 C) in the evening. Potting soils developed especially for
            gardenias are available.</p>
