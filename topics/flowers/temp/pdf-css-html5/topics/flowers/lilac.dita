   flower on old wood, and produce more flowers if unpruned. If pruned, the plant responds by
   producing fast-growing young vegetative growth with no flowers, in an attempt to restore the
   removed branches; a pruned lilac often produces few or no flowers for one to five or more years,
   before the new growth matures sufficiently to start flowering. Unpruned lilacs flower reliably
   every year. Despite this, a common fallacy holds that lilacs should be pruned regularly. If
   pruning is required, it should be done right after flowering is finished, before next year's
   flower buds are formed. Lilacs generally grow better in slightly alkaline soil. The wood of lilac
   is close-grained, diffuse-porous, extremely hard and one of the densest in Europe. The sapwood is
   typically cream-coloured and the heartwood has various shades of brown and purple. Lilac wood has
   traditionally been used for engraving, musical instruments, knife handles etc. When drying, the
   wood has a tendency to be encurved as a twisted material, and to split into narrow sticks. </p>
